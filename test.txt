Common fentanyl side effects
When used as a prescribed medicine, common fentanyl side effects may include:

headache, dizziness, drowsiness, pale skin, feeling weak or tired
constipation, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or
sleep problems (insomnia)
swelling in your hands or feet
increased sweating or cold feeling

Serious fentanyl side effects
Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to fentanyl: hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Like other narcotic medicines, fentanyl can slow your breathing. Death may occur if breathing becomes too weak. A person caring for you should seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue-colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.

Fentanyl may cause other serious side effects. Call your doctor at once if you have:

slow heart rate, sighing, shallow breathing, breathing that stops during sleep;
severe drowsiness, feeling like you might pass out;
confusion, extreme fear, unusual thoughts or behavior; or
low cortisol levels - nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dizziness, worsening tiredness or weakness.
Seek medical attention immediately if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as agitation, hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate, muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Serious side effects may be more likely in older adults and those who are malnourished or debilitated.

Long-term use of opioid medication may affect fertility (ability to have children) in men or women. It is not known whether opioid effects on fertility are permanent.

This is not a complete list of side effects, and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
